## Overview
This program will help you with Work Task Web API calls. It will ask for the name of the stored procedure. Then it will ask for the variables used in the store procedure, provided in a comma
seperated list. Then, in the same order as the variables, provide the types of the variables. After this, the program will return: The Base URI, the Request URI
(containing the stored procedure name), and the Data correctly formatted with all the needed "'s and \'s etc. 
Should be a simple copy and paste into the Data box. Lastly, replace the "XML_VAR_HERE"s with the propper XML variable names from your form.
